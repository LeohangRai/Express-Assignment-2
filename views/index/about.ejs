    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        This is a webapp created using the express library on Node js. The templating engine used in this webapp is Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS). In the users page, the user data from mongoDB database is loaded and shown in a table. We can add new users by going to the '/users/register' route. By doing so, the new user data will be saved in the database. For connecting and using the database, we have used the NPM mongoose package.
